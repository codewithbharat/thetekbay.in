Foods such as fiber-rich vegetables, legumes, and whole grains nourish the gut microbiome, leading to improved digestion and stronger immune function. Additionally, plant-based diets can reduce the risk of gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As awareness of gut health increases, more people are adopting plant-based diets to enhance their overall well-being.",
